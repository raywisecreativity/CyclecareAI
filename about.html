        <h2>What is PCOS?</h2>
        <p>
            Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is a common hormonal disorder that affects women of reproductive age. 
            It can cause irregular periods, excessive hair growth, acne, and infertility. PCOS is also associated 
            with insulin resistance, increasing the risk of type 2 diabetes and heart disease.
        </p>
        <p>
            While there is no cure for PCOS, lifestyle changes, medications, and proper medical guidance can help 
            manage its symptoms and improve overall well-being.
